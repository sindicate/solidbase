Major release
	Check the open issues
	Generate javadoc and check it
		When doing a minor release, you can check the changes with a subversion GUI
		Add all new html always with Tortoise, otherwise the tsvn:autoprops will not work
		Check the mime types of the html files
	Upgrade the version number
		solidbase/dist/pom.xml, project/build/plugins/plugin(solidbase)/version
		solidbase/maven-plugin/test/pom.xml, project/build/plugins/plugin(solidbase)/version
		solidbase/src/META-INF/maven/plugin.xml, plugin/version
		solidbase/build.properties, release.number (why did we call this release.number?)
		solidbase/pom.xml, project/version
		solidbase/deploy-pom.xml, project/version
		Use 1.6.0-RC1 when doing a first major release

	Check 'svn update && ant dist'
		Or 'ant clean build test'
	If release a candidate, test it at your current project
	'ant maven:deploy'
		Always update the working copy, otherwise you won't get a correct revXXX
		This deploys to the local solidbase-repository which is a checked out folder from subversion.
	Check and commit this local solidbase-repository
		Check that the size of the jar is indeed small (under 300KB)
		Comment "Released 1.6.0-RC1"
