Major release
	Check the open issues
	Generate javadoc and check it
		When doing a minor release, you can check the changes with a subversion GUI
	Upgrade the version number
		solidbase/dist/pom.xml, project/build/plugins/plugin(solidbase)/version
		solidbase/maven-plugin/test/pom.xml, project/build/plugins/plugin(solidbase)/version
		solidbase/src/META-INF/maven/plugin.xml, plugin/version
		solidbase/build.properties, release.number (why did we call this release.number?)
		solidbase/pom.xml, project/version
		solidbase/deploy-pom.xml, project/version
		Use 1.6.0-RC1 when doing a first major release
			We don't do snapshots. Snapshot are automatic releases, we don't do automatic.
	Check 'svn update && ant dist'
		Or 'ant clean build test'
	If release a candidate, test it at your current project
	'ant maven:deploy'
		This deploys to the local solidbase-repository which is a checked out folder from subversion.
	Check and commit this local solidbase-repository
		Check that the size of the jar is indeed small (under 300KB)
		Comment "Released 1.6.0-RC1"
	Create a tag
	Create a branch when you know that you are going to do major enhancements on the trunk
		Otherwise wait till you start doing new developments on the trunk
			or when a development branch is about to be merged to the trunk
