This Getting Started is generated by scripts/GenerateGettingStarted.groovy

(Use SolidBase 1.6.5 or newer.)

You should first read [Getting Started with SolidBase on the command-line](GettingStartedCommandLineWithArguments.md). That one contains details that are assumed knowledge in this Getting Started.

To start using SolidBase's Ant task, put solidbase.jar in a folder of your choosing. Get the driver jar for your database and put it in the same folder.

Create the upgrade script for the database named test-upgrade.sql:

```
--* DEFINITION
--*     SETUP "" --> "1.1"
--*     UPGRADE "" --> "1.0.1"
--*     UPGRADE "1.0.1" --> "1.0.2"
--* /DEFINITION



--* SETUP "" --> "1.1"

--* SECTION "Creating SolidBase control tables"

CREATE TABLE DBVERSION
(
    SPEC VARCHAR(5),
    VERSION VARCHAR(20),
    TARGET VARCHAR(20),
    STATEMENTS DECIMAL(4) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE DBVERSIONLOG
(
    TYPE VARCHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    SOURCE VARCHAR(20),
    TARGET VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    STATEMENT DECIMAL(4) NOT NULL,
    STAMP TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    COMMAND VARCHAR(4000),
    RESULT VARCHAR(4000)
);

CREATE INDEX DBVERSIONLOG_INDEX1 ON DBVERSIONLOG ( TYPE, TARGET );

--* /SETUP



--* UPGRADE "" --> "1.0.1"

--* SECTION "Creating table USERS"
CREATE TABLE USERS
(
    USER_ID INT NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    USER_USERNAME VARCHAR(26) NOT NULL,
    USER_PASSWORD VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
);

--* /UPGRADE



--* UPGRADE "1.0.1" --> "1.0.2"

--* SECTION "Inserting admin user"
INSERT INTO USERS ( USER_USERNAME, USER_PASSWORD ) VALUES ( 'admin', '*****' );

--* SECTION "Inserting user"
INSERT INTO USERS ( USER_USERNAME, USER_PASSWORD ) VALUES ( 'rene', '*****' );

--* /UPGRADE
```

You can find example upgrade scripts for Oracle, MySQL, Derby/JavaDB and HSQLDB/HyperSQL [here](http://code.google.com/p/solidbase/source/browse/trunk#trunk/dist).

Create the build.xml:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<project basedir=".">

	<taskdef resource="solidbasetasks" classpath="solidbase.jar;derby-10.5.3.0.jar" />

	<target name="upgradedb">
		<solidbase-upgrade driver="org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver" url="jdbc:derby:testant;create=true" 
			username="app" password="" 
			upgradefile="test-upgrade.sql" target="1.0.*" />
	</target>

</project>
```

The taskdef element also adds the driver jar to the classpath to make it available to SolidBase.

The folder now looks like:

```
G:\PROJECTS\BUILDS\solidbase\TEMP>dir
 Volume in drive G is WIN7
 Volume Serial Number is FAA5-5622

 Directory of G:\PROJECTS\BUILDS\solidbase\TEMP

07/25/2011  06:46 PM    <DIR>          .
07/25/2011  06:46 PM    <DIR>          ..
07/25/2011  06:46 PM               386 build.xml

07/25/2011  06:46 PM           283,084 solidbase.jar
07/25/2011  06:46 PM             1,178 test-upgrade.sql
               4 File(s)      2,796,837 bytes
               2 Dir(s)   5,300,277,248 bytes free

G:\PROJECTS\BUILDS\solidbase\TEMP>
```

Run the following command:

```
ant upgradedb
```

You get the following output:

```
G:\PROJECTS\BUILDS\solidbase\TEMP>ant upgradedb
Buildfile: G:\PROJECTS\BUILDS\solidbase\TEMP\build.xml

This concludes the Getting Started with the Ant task.

Enjoy!
